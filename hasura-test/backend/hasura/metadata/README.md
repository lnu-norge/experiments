# Hasura metadata

Holds metadata files that are automatically applied on startup, and automatically generated **if changes are made using the hasura CLI console, and not the web console**. (If changes are made with the hasura web console, metadata need to be manually added here)

See https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/migrations/advanced/auto-apply-migrations.html for more on how it works.
