# What kind of data could we aggregate?

## APIs

### Public APIs
See https://data.norge.no/ for ideas

#### Kartverket
üîç Kartverket has a series of APIs to be explored around getting addresses, lat/long etc. Could be useful!

#### Nasjonalt skoleregister
üîç List of schools https://data.norge.no/apis/2178a9a2-c30a-4380-a36a-922102c500f2 

Very promising! Has contact information, long/lat, addresses, etc. 
Missing info on website for the school. Might be found by scraping? / Google search? / Google Maps API?


### Commercial APIs

#### Google Maps
Has street view, so we can get a pic of most buildings for free. 



### Private APIs / Possible private APIs

We might not have access to all of these, or get access to them.

#### Bookup APIs 

#### Trondheim Bookingbasen APIs

#### Bergen / Stavanger Akt√∏rbasen APIs

#### Oslo K. APIs (future)

### Kulturhus i Norge
https://minside.ungdomogfritid.no/map/data.json
